# 🏆 Azure Codeathon 2025 Submission: SheetSense AI

## 🧠 Project Description

### What SheetSense AI Does
SheetSense AI is an intelligent Excel assistant that democratizes spreadsheet power through natural language processing. It transforms Excel from a tool requiring expertise into an accessible platform for everyone by allowing users to describe what they want in plain English and having AI handle the complex formulas, analysis, and visualizations.

### Problem It Solves
**The Core Problem**: Excel becomes so complex that users reach a point where they don't even know how to explain what they want to do with their data. This creates a massive barrier to productivity for 1.1 billion Excel users globally.

**Real-World Impact**:
- Financial analysts spend 30+ minutes on complex formulas that could take seconds
- 80% of Excel errors come from formula complexity
- Non-experts are locked out of advanced data analysis
- Knowledge workers waste hours on manual data queries

### Azure AI Integration
SheetSense AI leverages **Azure OpenAI Service** as its core intelligence engine:

1. **GPT-3.5-Turbo Model**: Powers natural language understanding and formula generation
2. **Structured Outputs**: Ensures reliable, consistent responses for Excel operations
3. **Context-Aware Processing**: Analyzes uploaded Excel files to provide personalized suggestions
4. **Multi-Modal AI**: Handles text input, file processing, and generates actionable insights

**Azure Services Used**:
- **Azure OpenAI Service**: Core AI processing and natural language understanding
- **Azure App Service**: Scalable web hosting platform
- **Azure Blob Storage**: File handling and temporary storage (configured)
- **Azure Application Insights**: Performance monitoring and analytics (ready)

## 💻 Working Prototype
